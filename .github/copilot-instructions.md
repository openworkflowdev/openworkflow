This file contains instructions for Copilot code review.

- Check changes against ARCHITECTURE.md & README.md and flag any inconsistencies
- Ensure new code follows the existing coding standards and style used elsewhere
- Verify that all new code has appropriate tests
- Always run the full CI checks (`npm run ci`) covering formatter, linter, tests, build, and typecheck; report results
