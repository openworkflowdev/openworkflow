# OpenWorkflow

OpenWorkflow is a TypeScript framework for building durable, resumable workflows that can pause for seconds or months, survive crashes and deploys, and resume exactly where they left off - all without extra servers to manage.

## What is OpenWorkflow?

OpenWorkflow allows developers to write **durable functions**, called workflows, that can survive process crashes, server restarts, and code deploys. It achieves this through a **worker-driven architecture** where stateless workers communicate with a durable backend (like PostgreSQL) to manage workflow state.

## Key Features

- **Durable Execution**: Workflows resume automatically after crashes or restarts
- **Step Memoization**: Each step executes exactly once and its result is cached
- **Worker-Driven**: No separate orchestrator server needed - just workers and a database
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with generics for input and output types
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple steps concurrently with `Promise.all`
- **Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers wait for in-flight workflows before stopping
- **Scalable**: Run multiple workers for high availability

## When to Use OpenWorkflow

OpenWorkflow is ideal for:

- **Long-running processes**: Multi-step workflows that take minutes, hours, or days
- **Mission-critical operations**: Payment processing, order fulfillment, data pipelines
- **API orchestration**: Coordinating multiple external API calls with retries
- **Background jobs**: Tasks that need to be reliable and resumable
- **Event-driven workflows**: Complex business processes triggered by events

## Quick Example

<Tabs groupId="language" items={['TypeScript']} persist>
<Tab value="TypeScript">

```ts
import { BackendPostgres } from "@openworkflow/backend-postgres";
import { OpenWorkflow } from "openworkflow";

const backend = await BackendPostgres.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const ow = new OpenWorkflow({ backend });

const sendWelcomeEmail = ow.defineWorkflow(
  { name: "send-welcome-email" },
  async ({ input, step }) => {
    const user = await step.run({ name: "fetch-user" }, async () => {
      return await db.users.findOne({ id: input.userId });
    });

    await step.run({ name: "send-email" }, async () => {
      return await email.send({ to: user.email, subject: "Welcome!" });
    });

    return { user };
  },
);

// Start a worker
const worker = ow.newWorker();
await worker.start();

// Run the workflow
await sendWelcomeEmail.run({ userId: "123" });
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

1. **Define workflows** with steps that represent checkpoints
2. **Start a worker** that polls your database for pending workflows
3. **Trigger workflows** from your application code
4. **Workers execute** the workflow, memoizing each step
5. **If a worker crashes**, another worker picks up and resumes from the last completed step

## Architecture Overview

OpenWorkflow uses a unique **worker-driven model**:

- **No central orchestrator**: Workers are the execution engine
- **Database as queue**: Your PostgreSQL database serves as both queue and state store
- **Stateless workers**: Workers can be started, stopped, and deployed independently
- **Deterministic replay**: Workflows execute from the beginning on each run, but completed steps return cached results instantly

## Current Status

OpenWorkflow is in **active development** (v0.1). The core features are stable and production-ready:

- ✅ PostgreSQL backend
- ✅ Worker with concurrency control
- ✅ Step memoization & retries
- ✅ Graceful shutdown
- ✅ Parallel step execution

Coming soon: CLI, Dashboard UI, workflow versioning, additional backends (Redis, SQLite), and more.
