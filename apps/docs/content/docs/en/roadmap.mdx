# Roadmap

OpenWorkflow is in active development and moving quickly. This page outlines what's been completed and what's coming next.

<Callout type="info" title="Active Development">
OpenWorkflow is currently in **v0.1** and under active development. The core features are stable and production-ready, but we're continuously adding new capabilities based on community feedback.
</Callout>

## Current Status: v0.1

The v0.1 release includes core functionality for building durable workflows:

### Completed Features

- **PostgreSQL Backend** - Full support for PostgreSQL as the state backend
- **Worker with Concurrency Control** - Run multiple workflows simultaneously with configurable concurrency
- **Step Memoization & Retries** - Automatic caching of completed steps and retry logic
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Workers wait for in-flight workflows before stopping
- **Parallel Step Execution** - Execute multiple steps concurrently with `Promise.all`
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with generic input/output types
- **Deterministic Replay** - Workflows resume from the last completed step after crashes

### Current Limitations

<Callout type="warn" title="Note on Tooling">
The v0.1 release doesn't yet include a dashboard UI or CLI. For now, you can inspect workflow and step state directly in PostgreSQL (`workflow_runs` and `step_attempts` tables). A CLI and dashboard are planned for an upcoming release to make debugging and monitoring much easier.
</Callout>

## Coming Soon

### 🔧 Developer Tools

<Cards>
  <Card title="CLI Tool" icon={<span>💻</span>}>
    Command-line interface for managing workflows, inspecting runs, and debugging issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dashboard UI" icon={<span>📊</span>}>
    Web-based dashboard for monitoring workflows, viewing execution history, and managing workers
  </Card>
</Cards>

**Use Cases:**
- View all workflow runs and their statuses
- Inspect step execution history
- Retry failed workflows
- Monitor worker health and performance
- Debug workflow issues visually

### Workflow Management

- **Workflow Versioning** - Deploy new workflow versions without breaking in-flight executions
- **Configurable Retry Policies** - Fine-grained control over retry behavior per workflow or step
- **Signals for External Events** - Send signals to running workflows to trigger actions
- **Workflow Cancellation** - Gracefully cancel running workflows
- **Scheduled Workflows** - Cron-like scheduling for recurring workflows
- **Workflow Timeouts** - Set execution time limits per workflow

### Additional Backends

Expand beyond PostgreSQL to support more infrastructure options:

- **Redis Backend** - Lower latency for high-throughput workflows with built-in pub/sub
- **SQLite Backend** - Zero-configuration local development and embedded deployments
- **DynamoDB Backend** (Under Consideration) - Serverless-native workflow execution

### Multi-Language SDKs

Expand OpenWorkflow to more programming languages:

- **Go SDK** - Planned for idiomatic Go workflow development
- **Python SDK** - Planned for Python developers and data science workflows
- **Rust SDK** (Under Consideration) - High-performance workflow execution

### Enterprise Features

- **Audit Logging** - Complete audit trail of all workflow executions
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions for workflows and workers
- **Encryption at Rest** - Encrypt sensitive workflow data in the database
- **Multi-Tenancy** - Isolate workflows by tenant/customer
- **Observability** - OpenTelemetry integration for tracing and metrics
