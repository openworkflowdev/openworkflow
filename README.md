# openworkflow

> **⚠️ In Development:** OpenWorkflow is in early development. Expect the first working version, v0.1, to be released on November 29.

OpenWorkflow is a WIP open-source TypeScript framework for building durable, resumable workflows.

Workflows can pause for seconds or months, survive crashes and deploys, and resume exactly where they stopped, all powered by a pluggable provider layer (Postgres first, Valkey & others soon).
