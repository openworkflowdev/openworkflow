## What is OpenWorkflow?

OpenWorkflow is a TypeScript framework that makes multi-step operations durable.
Wrap each operation in a step, and OpenWorkflow remembers which steps already
finished. If anything crashes, the workflow picks up right where it left off —
completed steps are never re-run.

```ts
import { defineWorkflow } from "openworkflow";

export const processOrder = defineWorkflow(
  { name: "process-order" },
  async ({ input, step }) => {
    // if the server crashes after this step, the card is NOT charged again
    await step.run({ name: "charge-card" }, async () => {
      await payments.charge(input.orderId);
    });

    await step.run({ name: "send-confirmation" }, async () => {
      await emails.send({ to: input.email, subject: "Order confirmed!" });
    });
  },
);
```

## Features

<div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
  <div>
    <Icon icon="shield-check" /> **Durable** - Workflows survive process
    restarts and server crashes. Completed steps are never repeated.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Icon icon="rotate-right" /> **Resumable** - After a crash or deploy,
    workflows pick up from the last completed step automatically.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Icon icon="clock" /> **Pausable** - Workflows can sleep for seconds or
    months without tying up resources.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Icon icon="code" /> **Type Safe** - First-class TypeScript support for
    inputs and outputs.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Icon icon="database" /> **No Extra Servers** - Uses your existing database
    (PostgreSQL or SQLite). No separate queue or orchestration service.
  </div>
</div>
