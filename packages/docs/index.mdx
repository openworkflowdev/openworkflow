## What is OpenWorkflow?

OpenWorkflow is a TypeScript framework for building durable, resumable workflows
that can pause for seconds or months, survive crashes and deploys, and resume
exactly where they left off - all without extra servers to manage.

Initialize a workflow in a few lines:

```ts
import { defineWorkflow } from "openworkflow";

export const sendWelcomeEmail = defineWorkflow(
  { name: "send-welcome-email" },
  async ({ input, step }) => {
    const user = await step.run({ name: "fetch-user" }, async () => {
      return await db.users.findOne({ id: input.userId });
    });

    await step.run({ name: "send-email" }, async () => {
      return await resend.emails.send({
        from: "me@example.com",
        to: user.email,
        replyTo: "me@example.com",
        subject: "Welcome!",
        html: "<h1>Welcome to our app!</h1>",
      });
    });

    await step.run({ name: "mark-welcome-email-sent" }, async () => {
      await db.users.update(input.userId, { welcomeEmailSent: true });
    });

    return { user };
  },
);
```
