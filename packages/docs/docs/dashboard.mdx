OpenWorkflow includes a built-in dashboard for monitoring and inspecting
workflow runs.

## Starting the Dashboard

```bash
npx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

The dashboard starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Requirements

The dashboard requires:

1. A valid `openworkflow.config.ts` in your project
2. A running backend (PostgreSQL or SQLite)

The dashboard connects to the same backend as your workers.
