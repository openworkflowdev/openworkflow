OpenWorkflow includes a built-in web dashboard for monitoring and debugging your
workflows. It lets you browse workflow runs, see which steps completed or
failed, inspect errors, and track the state of long-running workflows.

## Starting the Dashboard

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

```bash bun
bunx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

</CodeGroup>

The dashboard starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Requirements

The dashboard requires:

1. A valid `openworkflow.config.ts` in your project
2. A running backend (PostgreSQL or SQLite)

The dashboard connects to the same backend as your workers. It shows data for
the namespace configured in your config file.

<Note>
  The dashboard does not include built-in authentication. For production use,
  deploy it behind a VPN, private network, or reverse proxy with Basic Auth.
