title: Migrating to v0.6
description: How to upgrade from v0.5 to v0.6
---

v0.6 moves the database backends into the core `openworkflow` package. This
simplifies installation, reduces dependency management, and makes imports
cleaner. Here's everything you need to know to upgrade.

## Step-by-Step Migration

### 1. Update Your Imports

Find and replace the old import paths:

```diff
// openworkflow.config.ts
- import { BackendPostgres } from "@openworkflow/backend-postgres";
+ import { BackendPostgres } from "openworkflow/postgres";

// openworkflow/client.ts
- import { BackendSqlite } from "@openworkflow/backend-sqlite";
+ import { BackendSqlite } from "openworkflow/sqlite";
```

### 2. Update Your Dependencies

Remove the legacy packages:

```bash
npm uninstall @openworkflow/backend-postgres @openworkflow/backend-sqlite
```

If you're using PostgreSQL, install the `postgres` driver directly:

```bash
npm install postgres
```

Your `package.json` should now look like:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "openworkflow": "^0.6.0",
    "postgres": "^3.4.8" // Only if using PostgreSQL
  }
}
```

### 3. That's It

No other changes needed. The backend API is identical.

## New Projects

If you're starting fresh, just run:

```bash
npx @openworkflow/cli init
```

The CLI now generates code with the new import paths automatically.
