title: OpenWorkflow vs Temporal
description: A comparison of OpenWorkflow and Temporal for durable workflow orchestration

import ComparisonDurableWorkflow from "/snippets/comparison-durable-workflow.mdx";

## TL;DR

Temporal is a distributed workflow platform with mature multi-language SDKs.
Running it yourself means operating Temporal Server and its persistence backend.

OpenWorkflow gives you durable workflows without a separate orchestration
service. Workers coordinate directly through PostgreSQL or SQLite.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

In Temporal, a multi-step process requires a workflow definition, separate
Activity implementations, and a running Temporal Server connected to a
persistence backend.

With OpenWorkflow, you write one function:

<ComparisonDurableWorkflow />

## When OpenWorkflow is the Better Fit

### No separate orchestration service

Self-hosted Temporal typically requires running multiple services and a
persistence backend:

- **Frontend Service** - gRPC gateway
- **History Service** - workflow state and event history
- **Matching Service** - task routing
- **Worker Service** - internal Temporal system workflows
- **Persistence** - MySQL or PostgreSQL with Temporal schema
- **Optional visibility store** - Elasticsearch or similar for advanced queries

Operating those pieces adds monitoring, capacity, upgrade, and incident
response work.

OpenWorkflow uses your existing PostgreSQL or SQLite. Your workers talk directly
to your database. There are no intermediary services to scale, monitor, or
debug.

### Smaller API surface for common TypeScript use cases

Temporal exposes multiple timeout classes and retry options per workflow and
activity. That flexibility is useful when you need it.

OpenWorkflow keeps the default surface smaller (`step.run`, `step.sleep`,
retries with backoff, optional `deadlineAt`) and is often faster to adopt for
TypeScript teams that want fewer moving parts.

## When Temporal is the Right Call

- **Polyglot platform**: You need one orchestration platform across multiple
  languages.
- **Advanced runtime interaction**: You need Signals, Queries, Updates, or
  Activity heartbeats. These are coming to OpenWorkflow but are available right
  now in Temporal.
- **Dedicated platform ownership**: Your team can operate Temporal Server as
  shared infrastructure.
