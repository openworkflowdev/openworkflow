title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with OpenWorkflow
---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL (and/or SQLite)

## 1. Install

Install and set up OpenWorkflow with:

```bash
npx @openworkflow/cli init
```

The CLI will prompt for your backend, install dependencies, and generate several
files.

## 2. Start a worker

```bash
npx @openworkflow/cli worker start
```

This runs the worker using `openworkflow.config.{ts,js}` and auto-loads
workflows from the configured directories (default: `openworkflow/`).

## 3. Run workflows from your app

Run a workflow from anywhere:

```ts
// trigger.ts
import { helloWorld } from "./openworkflow/hello-world.js";
import { BackendSqlite } from "@openworkflow/backend-sqlite";
import { OpenWorkflow } from "openworkflow";

const backend = BackendSqlite.connect("openworkflow/backend.db");
const ow = new OpenWorkflow({ backend });

// Run the workflow
const handle = await ow.runWorkflow(helloWorld.spec, {});

// Wait for the result
const result = await handle.result();
console.log(result); // { greeting: "Hello, World!" }
```

## 4. View workflows in the dashboard

View your workflows using the built-in dashboard:

```bash
npx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

The dashboard provides a UI for monitoring workflow runs, viewing step details,
and inspecting workflow state.
