title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with OpenWorkflow
---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL (and/or SQLite)

## 1. Install

Install and set up OpenWorkflow with:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx @openworkflow/cli init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx @openworkflow/cli init
```

```bash bun
bunx @openworkflow/cli init
```

</CodeGroup>

The CLI will help you set up OpenWorkflow, create your `openworkflow.config.ts`,
and generate an example workflow.

## 2. Start a worker

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx @openworkflow/cli worker start
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx @openworkflow/cli worker start
```

```bash bun
bunx @openworkflow/cli worker start
```

</CodeGroup>

This starts the worker using `openworkflow.config.{ts,js}` and auto-loads
workflows from the configured directories (default: `openworkflow/`).

## 3. Run workflows from your app

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
# TypeScript
npx tsx openworkflow/hello-world.run.ts
# JavaScript
node openworkflow/hello-world.run.js
```

```bash pnpm
# TypeScript
pnpx tsx openworkflow/hello-world.run.ts
# JavaScript
node openworkflow/hello-world.run.js
```

```bash bun
bun openworkflow/hello-world.run.ts
```

</CodeGroup>

This script runs the `helloWorld` workflow and waits for it to complete.

<Note>
  This file is a temporary dev helper. Copy the code into your app (e.g., an API
  route or a script) and modify it to run your workflows, then delete the file.
</Note>

## 4. View workflows in the dashboard

View your workflows using the built-in dashboard:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

```bash bun
bunx @openworkflow/cli dashboard
```

</CodeGroup>

The dashboard provides a UI for monitoring workflow runs, viewing step details,
and inspecting workflow state.
