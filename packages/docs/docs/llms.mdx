title: Building with LLMs
description: Use LLMs to build OpenWorkflow workflows
---

You can use large language models (LLMs) to assist in the building of your
OpenWorkflow workflows.

## Plain text docs

You can access all of our documentation as plain text markdown files by adding
.md to the end of any url. For example, you can find the plain text version of
this page itself at https://openworkflow.dev/docs/llms.md.

## llms.txt

We provide an `/llms.txt` file at the root of our docs site. This file
adheres to the emerging standard for providing AI agents with a map of our
docs, allowing tools to retrieve plain text versions of our pages
efficiently.
