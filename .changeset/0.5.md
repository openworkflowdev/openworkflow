### openworkflow

- **New Tooling:** Introduced the OpenWorkflow CLI (`@openworkflow/cli`) for
  easier project management.
- **New Feature:** Added `defineWorkflowSpec` for declarative workflow
  definitions. This allows you to define the shape of a workflow (input/output
  types, name, schema) separately from its implementation.
- **New Feature:** Added `deadlineAt` option to workflow definitions. This
  allows workflows to automatically fail if they exceed a specific duration
  (Thanks @Shobhit-Nagpal).
- **Deprecation:** `declareWorkflow` is now deprecated. Please use
  `defineWorkflowSpec` instead.

### @openworkflow/cli

- **Initial Release:** Introduced the `openworkflow` CLI (alias `ow`).
- Added `ow init`: Interactively initializes new projects, configuring the
  backend (SQLite/Postgres) and generating necessary boilerplate.
- Added `ow worker start`: Starts a worker process with automatic workflow
  discovery based on `openworkflow.config.ts`.
- Added `ow doctor`: Verifies environment configuration, dependencies, and lists
  discovered workflows.
- Added support for `openworkflow.config.ts` for declarative project
  configuration.
