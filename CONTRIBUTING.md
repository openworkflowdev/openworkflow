# Contributing to OpenWorkflow

Contributions are very welcome!

Anything that changes the workflow API, step API, core scheduler, or storage
model need a quick design convo first so we can keep things high-quality. Just
[open an issue](https://github.com/openworkflowdev/openworkflow/issues/new)
describing what you'd like to do. [This is a great
example](https://github.com/openworkflowdev/openworkflow/issues/16).

The same should happen for documentation and business facing stuff, like e.g. websites (though those are in general 'core-team' stuff). So, as a general rule:

=> Before working on something, [file an issue first](https://github.com/openworkflowdev/openworkflow/issues/new) so everything can be clarified.
